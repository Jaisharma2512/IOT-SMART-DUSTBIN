# IOT-SMART-DUSTBIN
Ideated and was End to End process owner of an app that streamlined information to Google Firebase via a Microcontroller integrated with an  electric, Wi-Fi connected dustbin. • Notifying on application real time Waste Collection monitoring through Volume Rule Setting.
This IOT based project can be used for the cleanliness of the cities and helps to determine the extra garbage in a dustbin when it reaches its threshold. This garbage management system is being used in many countries of the world now like South Korea, Singapore, etc.This is a very efficient way to know when the dustbins are filled and can be very time saving and efficient.
